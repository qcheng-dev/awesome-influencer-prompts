# awesome-influencer-prompts
A repo that contains awesome prompts for influencers to manage their social accounts. 

## What is it for?

This branch includes well-tested prompts which social influencers can use to get benefit from latest AI products (ChatGPT,etc.). The goal is to create a dedicated community for social influencers to find resources they need, without extra effort of searching from common purpose prompt repose such as [Awesome ChatGPT Prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts).

## How to use?


### ChatGPT Prompts
The prompts are presented as `.csv` files, for example [ChatGPT - General purpose prompts](./chatgpt-prompts/general.csv). First column is the purpose and the second column is the prompt text. Feel free to copy-paste the text to ChatGPT and check the answers :).
